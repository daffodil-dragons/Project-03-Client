## Project Description

This app will serve as a character sheet creator for a Dungeons & Dragons 5E player. They will be able to also update their character sheet as they play and level up. The frontend will allow you to input character information and update the display.

## User Stories

As a user I want to use an app to create a D&D character sheet, so that I can easily have access to updating and managing multiple character sheets at once.
